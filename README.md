## Objective
Utilize Socket.IO to create a real-time collaborative drawing application. My classmate, [@dkendrick25](https://github.com/dkendrick25) and I worked together to include an additional chat functionality which transformed the app into a Pictionary-style game
* Utilized: Socket.IO, Express Node.js, HTML5 canvas, HTML, CSS, and jQuery

### Phase 1: Establish Core Functionalities - Drawing Canvas and Chat
